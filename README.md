This game is based in the Glitch Garden section of the GameDev.tv Unity 2D course.

My original implementations are:
- Different background images and sprites for player characters and enemies. I had to make ample use of GIMP and TexturePacker to edit the sprites and spritesheets to suit my needs. I had to research deeper info on spritesheet animation in Unity than what was given in the course.
- Created particle effects from scratch to represent elven and orc blood.
- Created projectile animations (arrow and ice spell) extracting the relevant pieces from existing sprites and moving them through code.
- Different background music for each level.
- The ability to set different volume levels for the background music and the SFXs.
- Greater amount of SFXs.
